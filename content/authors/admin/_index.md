I am currently in the last year of my Master's in Physics (option Theoretical Physics) at the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven; Belgium). I have a broad interest in physics, focused on its theoretical, mathematical, and phenomenological aspects, with a special affinity for theoretical condensed matter, such as nonequilibrium physics, quantum Many-Body theory, statistical mechanics, and quantum theory in a broader sense, such as quantum foundations. This culminated in my master’s degree in physics, with a major in high energy physics and a minor in theoretical condensed matter. In my study trajectory, I have never allowed my interests to be overshadowed by intellectual challenges, which eventually paid off during my master’s. Gradually mastering my courses on an upward trajectory, as well as doing research for my master's thesis and research internship, has pushed me to pursue a research career in theoretical physics.
