I am currently in the last year of my Master's in Theoretical Physics at KU Leuven (Belgium). I have a broad interest in physics, focused on its theoretical, mathematical, and phenomenological aspects, with a special affinity for theoretical condensed matter, such as non-equilibrium physics, quantum Many-Body theory, statistical mechanics, and quantum theory in a broader sense. This culminated in my master’s degree in physics, with a major in high energy physics and a minor in theoretical condensed matter. Gradually mastering, as well as doing research for my master's thesis and research internship, has pushed me to pursue a research career in theoretical physics.
